# Machine Learning Final Project
This is 2023 fall Machine Learning Final Project. <br>
There are 3 tasks in this project. <br>
1.Apply SAM to BTCV dataset and use mDice to evaluate the model's performance. Code is in file "segmentation_task1.py". <br>
2.Finetune SAM with BTCV dataset and make comparison with the original model on the segmentation performance. Code is in file "finetune_task2.py". <br>
3.Modifiy the original mask decoder to enable the model to classify the organs besides simply segmenting. Code for modified classifier is in file "modified_classifier.py", and code for its training and validation is in file "classify_train_task3.py" and "classify_val_task3.py" perspectively.
